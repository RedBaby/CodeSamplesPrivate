 //	ASSETS
 //	  
 //		The external assets are divided into two locations with specific purposes
 //
 //		assets_runtime     - 	Those that are accessed at runtime *and* those that are 
 //								needed to be copied to destination folder to live *adjacent* 
 //								to the app binary.
 //
 //		assets_compiletime -    Those that are accessed at compile-time and baked *into* the 
 //								app binary.
