//TASKS FOR ELLIOT

----NAME: ASSET-LOCATION VETTING AND DECIDING
----PRIORITY: Well, file setup is v0.5, but customization is really much later, hmmmm...

	**discuss the location of files
	**demo the setting of 	applicationDPI in Main.mxml. Do we want that? Need that?
	**propose solution for folders and naming of all runtime/compiletime (remember those are in each MobileSingle and MobileLibrary)
	**goals: readability, update-ability, DRY, keep swf vs png options alive, go with png only by default
	**philosophy: if it can be vector (settings icons, ect...) it should. Stuff that cannot be?: splash images, OS-icons, logos (because we want easy photoshopability)
	**
	**rename files/folders
	**then pitch a logo and color scheme for the app (include easy-to-test-DPI-specific-colors) so we can test it out
	**create a (partial?) set of all assets
	**
    **look at the customization demo. Should it live on and link to shared library files. I think yes. 1-2 pages with all components we want to use. Easy testing ground
	
	
	
	
----NAME: DEVICE-SPECIFIC-TESTS on MobileSingle version v0.5 after delivery to client - Test on both platform emulators and both platform devices.
----PRIORITY: post version v0.5 delivery to client.
	* What happens when app sent to background? 
	* What is call comes in while app is in use?
	* How/when is a user kicked out of a channel or his mode changed (manual logout?, manual closing (not minimizing) of app?, anything else?)
	* do all views, all buttons, all (few that we have) styles working? Any per-device hiccups or performance?
	* Any layout issues on various screen sizes?
	
----NAME		:	OPTIMIZATIONS PRE-ANALYSIS on MobileSingle version v0.5
----PRIORITY	:	post version v0.5 delivery to client.
	* See how the app runs on both platform emulators and both platform devices
	* Evaluate optimizations NEEDED. Proposal a plan to revise or moving-forward do optimization.
	* Garbage Collection analysis. Look over the STARTUP/SHUTDOWN commands and look at every UI and MEdiator file. Are they removing listeners properly and being RAM-conscious? 
    * Provide time/times in future we need to check all of this again. 
    * is our 'view' push and pop working properly. We have exactly 2 (during transition) or 1 view in memory at any time? No others are hiding, right?
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
----NAME		: Empower 'not a member' button to click to www.chattrspace.com
----PRIORITY	: before v0.9 delivery
	* Create a NavigateToURLSignal/NavigateToURLSignalEvent (url, window)/NavigateToURLSignalCommand
	* wire that up to notamemeber (later we'll use it more too)
	* 
	
----NAME		: Update API for ViewNavigator stuff
----PRIORITY	: before v0.9 delivery
	* Change the API (the general naming of methods, classes etc...), but the functionality is generally good.
	* Search 'viewNavigatorPushViewSignal.dispatch(new ViewNavigatorEvent' in the project and see how it works
	* Consider ditching both 'push' and 'pop' and just have one signal that takes an event. The event knows push vs pop. 
	* Rename 'ViewNavigatorEvent' too because its the same name as an Adobe class and I want to avoid name conflicts like that
	
----NAME		: Change Toggle Button Text for MainViewUI
----PRIORITY	: before v0.9 delivery
	* Change text to "comments" and "users" not "off" and "on". Research solutions. I suspect a skin is needed - http://devgirl.org/2011/11/02/flex-mobile-development-toggleswitch-sample-with-source/
	* The inner-bg changes from blue to grey. The current highlight looks good, but we want to use css for the 'blue' and 'grey' so we can replace them. Make them colorable a quick-n-dirty way and we can do the css part later
